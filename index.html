      <h1>THE NEW WOMAN</h1>
      <p>

If you want to help, to connect and to inspire, if you want to make a difference in the world, if you want to share your fears, your dreams, your victories, this is your home because YOU are The New Woman.<br />

          <h1>WHY CREATE THENEWOMAN.COM?</h1>
            <p>
              <span>It does NOT exist.</span></br>
              We are always saying that together we are stronger, but the truth is that if we take a look we are still divided by niches.  You can easily find online communities for “female in something”: designers, programmers, business... and the list goes on! I wonder, what would it be like if we were all together in one place?<br/>
              <br/>
              <span>It’s necessary!</span></br>
              My struggle as an entrepeneur in a small Island of the Atlantic may not make much sense for someone in a big metropolis trying to reach the next millionth customer but it might mean the world for someone else that, just like me, is going through the same things on an island of the pacific for example.<br />
              <br />
              <span>Sharing from the heart</span></br>
              It’s great to read motivational articles on how to overcome obstacles but I wouldn’t it be even better if we could know how someone felt while it was struggling to surpass it, what someone thought, did, said all told in a genuine way, straight from the heart.

          <h1>WHAT IS IT?</h1>
            <p>
              <span>It’s all about the stories.</span></br>
              How many more “Top 10 X to do Y” articles do we really need? The Newoman is an Open Source Community where you can share your struggle, and the perfect place for sharing your story of success while it happens and not only when you finally get there. <br/>
              <br/>
              <span>Someone like me.</span></br>
              If you’re a woman in you mid-50’s trying to teach the homeless new skills or a teenager learning IT so that you can create new ways of communicating, there’s someone out there struggling to do something similar or even the exact same thing. Thenewoman is the place where you can find those people and relate to them in a new way.<br />
              <br />
              <span>Because everyone matters.</span></br>
              It doesn’t matter what your dream is, or where you live, your story, your struggle, your words can change someone’s life forever. In Thenewoman there is no bias for countries or languages we’re only lead by good heartfelt stories doesn’t matter where they come from.

          <h1>HOW WILL IT BE BUILT?</h1>
            <p>
              <span>For the New Woman by the New Woman.</span></br>
              As an open-source community we want it to be built by the new woman and so we want everyone to be a part of its development and having a say in what is created and help Lim9 making this dream that is called The New Woman come true. <br/>
              <br/>
              <span>A new world language.</span></br>
              While the English Language has a huge reach it still doesn’t reach everyone and in most cases actually works as a barrier of entry for a lot of people that cannot understand it well enough, or cannot express themselves as good while using a foreign language. A touching and heartfelt story will always remain a great story no matter what language it was written in. That’s why we want to make use of the power of the crowd and allow people to translate other people’s content to their native language so as to truly create an International Content Network.<br />
              <br />
              <span>The sky is not the limit.</span></br>
              Thenewoman will always be just as big as all its women and we will always fight to increase our reach further and further so that one day we may truly reach every single New Woman out there. May it be through creating networking events, a sms app for underdeveloped countries or even a tour bus to visit some hard-access villages. The sky will NEVER be our limit.

          <h1>WHO'S DOING IT?</h1>
            <p>
              I was born in Madeira Island, a small place in the middle of the Atlantic, so as you can imagine it, i was already born isolated from everything. But hey, that was not a bad thing! Through it I grew up to become a very curious and determined girl.  <br/>
              <br/>
              At the age of 20 i fell in love with a dreamy man and he became my partner in everything: life & business. And so Lim9 was born because we wanted to do things differently, to revolutionize the creative industry and the relationship with our customers. Together we created this new Creative Startup whose motto is Developing Dreams With You.  <br />
              <br />
              Working in a male dominated industry and being in charge of our company has its good and bad days. Sometimes when i need to lift my head up and find the strength to go on I find myself asking if there aren’t other women out there just like me, fighting the same battles, feeling the same things. How great would it be to know how they overcome those bad days and how they celebrate the good ones?  <br />
              <br />
              That’s why I have decided to create The New Woman! 
              I asked my team at Lim9 for help, and now I’m asking you, the fighters, because I believe that we can change everything, I believe that we can inspire and we can give strength to others in need. I believe that there are thousands of women like me, having the same thoughts that i have everyday and it’s time for us to find each other. <br />
              <br />
              My name is Candy Freitas and I am “The New Woman”. What about you?
